**Supermarket Sales Prediction**

This project aims to predict the sales of a supermarket chain based on historical data from the year 2013. The dataset contains information about 1559 products across 10 stores located in different cities. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify the products and stores that play a key role in driving sales, allowing the supermarket chain to take appropriate measures to improve business success.
